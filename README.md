### How to use the components
Install the components via npm. Please checkout the individual readme for each component from the table above.
 
Starting with version 0.2.0 every component has no css styles imported by default. You need to setup your build pipeline 
to include the scss files from each component you want to use. This makes it possible to configure the theming for
the components you want to use.

If you are using webpack you may use the special webpack import syntax for node_modules:

```
@import '~angular2-mdl/scss/color-definitions';

$color-primary: $palette-blue-500;
$color-primary-dark: $palette-blue-700;
$color-accent: $palette-amber-A200;
$color-primary-contrast: $color-dark-contrast;
$color-accent-contrast: $color-dark-contrast;

@import '~angular2-mdl/src/scss-mdl/material-design-lite';

@import '~@angular2-mdl-ext/popover/popover';
@import '~@angular2-mdl-ext/select/select';
```

An other way is to include each component folder in the search path for your scss preprocessor. For example webpack:

```
	sassLoader: {
		includePaths: [
			'node_modules/@angular2-mdl-ext/popover',
			'node_modules/@angular2-mdl-ext/select'
		]
	}
```

If you are using an angular cli project you want to add the two lines of code to the angular-cli.json

```
{
    "apps": [{
            "styles": [
              "../node_modules/@angular2-mdl-ext/popover/popover.scss", <-- add this
              "../node_modules/@angular2-mdl-ext/select/select.scss" <-- add this
            ],
        }],
}

```

### Development

* npm start - local dev server
* npm build - build a production release
* npm start test - run the unit tests
